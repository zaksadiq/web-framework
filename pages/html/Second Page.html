   focused on cultivating a style of thinking that transcends
   traditional learning methods.</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>“The reason this happens is that the creators have to fight
   through so many dark difficulties, and wade through so much
   misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the light as others
   can, now the door is open and the path made easy.”</p>
   </blockquote>
